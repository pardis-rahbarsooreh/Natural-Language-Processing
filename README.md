# Codecademy - Data Scientist: Natural Language Processing Specialist

### Introduction
Welcome! I am currently enrolled in a career path of [NLP Specialist](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science-nlp) course in [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). To better understand, I am also practicing the codes on my own computer apart from Codecademy's workspace.

Here, I will add those simple but very informative practices about this area. I also added comments to the codes so they are easier to understand.
