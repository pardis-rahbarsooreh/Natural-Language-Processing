# Codecademy - Data Scientist: Natural Language Processing Specialist

### Introduction
Welcome! I am currently enrolled in a career path of [NLP Specialist](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science-nlp) course in [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). For better understanding, I am also practicing the codes in my own computer apart from the Codecademy's workspace.

Here I will add those practices which are simple but very informative about this area. I add comments to the codes so it is easier to understand.

1. Text Processing



P.S. README and codes are still updating. The whole project descriptions and required packages will be updated completely once the course is finished!
